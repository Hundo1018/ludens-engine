"""Tire force model for the raycast vehicle (ROADMAP 17.4).

A tire turns a contact-patch slip into a force. The shape is a normalised
Pacejka "magic formula" `y = sin(C atan(Bx - E(Bx - atan(Bx))))`: zero at zero
slip, a single peak, then a fall-off toward a lower sliding level -- the curve
every vehicle SDK (PhysX, Jolt, Chaos) fits, here reduced to three numbers.
`TireCurve` locates the peak numerically at construction and divides it out, so
`norm(1) == 1` and the peak slip is a plain field, not a function of B, C, E.

COMBINED SLIP. Longitudinal slip ratio `kappa = (w R - vx) / max(|vx|, vmin)`
and lateral slip `tan(alpha) = -vy / max(|vx|, vmin)` are each divided by their
own peak slip, and the force is the curve of the vector norm along the vector's
direction: a friction ellipse with the Pacejka falloff. Braking while turning
therefore costs lateral grip and the wheel can never exceed `mu Fz` in any
direction.

LOW SPEED. `max(|vx|, vmin)` keeps the slip finite at a standstill (the SAE
definition divides by zero), and `force_limit` is the implicit clamp: a force
that would reverse the slip velocity inside one step is cut to exactly the
value that cancels it, which removes the jitter an explicit friction model has
when parked on a slope.
