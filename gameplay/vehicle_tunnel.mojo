"""A coarse virtual wind tunnel for a car shape: LBM Cd -> vehicle drag (ROADMAP 17.4).

The differentiator of this vehicle model is not the wheel code (every engine
has one) but that the body's drag coefficient can come from the engine's own
fluid solver. This builds a voxel car in a `fluid.lbm.Lbm` tunnel, runs it to a
quasi-steady state, averages the momentum-exchange force on the solid (ROADMAP
14.4) and reports `Cd = Fx / (1/2 rho u^2 A)`. `Aero.from_cd` turns the number
into the vehicle's aerodynamic drag.

HONEST LIMITS. The lattice Reynolds number is ~25-50 (a real car is ~1e6), the
car is a staircase voxelisation, there is no ground plane or moving floor and
the blockage ratio is a few percent -- so the ABSOLUTE Cd is a lattice number,
not a road car's. What carries over is the ordering of shapes (a sloped nose
measures lower than a flat one, `test_vehicle_aero`) and the plumbing: any
future higher-resolution or GPU tunnel (`fluid/lbm_gpu`) yields a Cd that
drops into the same `Aero`. `scaled_cd` lets a caller calibrate a lattice
result against a known reference shape.
