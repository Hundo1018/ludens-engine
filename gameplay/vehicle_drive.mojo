"""Engine, gearbox and differentials for the raycast vehicle (ROADMAP 17.4).

Pure arithmetic with no scene access, so it is unit-tested on its own
(`test_vehicle_drive`). The chain, per step:

    throttle -> torque curve at engine rpm -> gear ratio * final drive
             -> centre split between axles -> axle differential -> wheel torque

ENGINE RPM follows the driven wheels through the gearbox (a locked clutch)
except at launch: below `launch_rpm` the clutch is taken to slip and the
engine runs at `launch_rpm` under throttle, so a standing start has torque
instead of stalling at idle. Above `redline_rpm` fuel is cut. Off the throttle
the engine drags with `engine_brake` Nm at redline, scaling linearly with rpm.

DIFFERENTIALS split an axle's torque between its two wheels:
* open    equal torque. A wheel on ice gets as much as one on tarmac, which is
          the model of a real open differential's torque equality; the
          approximation is that the tarmac wheel is NOT also limited to the
          ice wheel's tiny torque (see TODO in ROADMAP 17.4).
* limited-slip  moves torque from the faster wheel to the slower one by
          `preload + lock * |dw|` (Nm), capped at `max_bias`.
* locked  both wheels get the torque a spool would give a stuck pair: the
          bias is unbounded (up to the whole axle torque).
