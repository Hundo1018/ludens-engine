# Precompile every ludens-engine package into build/*.mojoc, in dependency order.
# This nightly only resolves cross-file imports through precompiled .mojoc on the
# -I path (source dirs are not searched), so packages must be built before tests.
#
# Outputs are staged OUTSIDE the -I path and moved in only when complete: the
# compiler creates the output file before resolving imports (observed on
# 1.0.0b3.dev2026071805), so a package whose own absolute self-imports resolve
# through -I would otherwise find its half-written (or stale) .mojoc.
