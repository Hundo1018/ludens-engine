# tier: integration
"""17.38 wired through the production entry point: `scheduler.events.Channel`
driven by `scheduler.gameloop.FixedLoop`'s real tick count over several
frames -- not a hand-rolled frame counter -- checking the exact guarantee the
roadmap note states: a reader running before or after the writer in a frame
still sees each event exactly once.

Contact-event wiring through a REAL `ContactScene6` stack is a separate file
(`tests/test_events_contacts.mojo`), so THIS file does not import `physics`
alongside `scheduler.gameloop` + `ecs`: doing all three together in one file
is exactly the shape `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §3 reserves for the (currently
empty) `system` tier, not `integration` -- this file stays `integration`
(span = {scheduler, ecs}) on purpose.

WHAT "before or after the writer" MEANS HERE: `r_after` reads once per frame,
right after that frame's `send`+`update` -- it sees each frame's event
immediately, the same frame it was produced. `r_before` reads once per frame,
BEFORE that frame's `send`+`update` runs -- structurally identical to a
reader system that happens to be scheduled ahead of the event-producing
system that tick. It can never see the CURRENT frame's own event (it hasn't
been sent yet when `r_before` reads), so it is always exactly one frame
behind -- but the double-buffer retention means it is never MORE than one
frame behind: nothing is lost, only delayed by one read. The test proves
this by giving `r_before` one extra read after the loop ends and checking
its running total then reaches the full count."""
