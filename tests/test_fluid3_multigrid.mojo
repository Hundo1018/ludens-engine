"""3-D multigrid pressure solve on `MacFluid3` (ROADMAP 17.60,
`numerics.multigrid3` `PeriodicPoissonMG3`, the 3-D counterpart of 17.84).

A 32^3 periodic box with a deterministic, non-symmetric velocity field (not a
symmetric flow, so no term of the projection vanishes by symmetry). The same
field is projected twice: once with Jacobi-preconditioned CG (the default) and
once with `use_multigrid()` (MGPCG). Both solve the same Poisson problem to
the same tolerance, 1e-6.

Predictions, written before the run:

  * MGPCG needs at most 25 iterations, and Jacobi PCG needs at least 3 times
    as many. The 2-D result (17.84) is a constant-iteration count against an
    n-dependent one; the 3-D count should follow it.
  * Both paths converge.
  * The projected velocities agree: max |u_mg - u_jacobi| below 1e-3 of
    max |u| (both solve to the same residual; the difference is the
    tolerance, not a different answer).
  * After projection the divergence is below 1e-3 of its value before.
  * n = 12 (not a power of two) makes `use_multigrid` raise.

Measured (one run, n = 32): Jacobi PCG 56 iterations, MGPCG 3; both residuals
about 1e-6. Max |u| difference 2.6e-6 relative. Divergence after projection
2.2e-4 (Jacobi) and 3.8e-4 (MGPCG), from 131 before. All six checks pass.

The 25-iteration bound was set before the run and is loose: the measured MGPCG
count is 3. Only n = 32 is measured here. The claim that the count stays
constant as n grows is not tested by this file.
