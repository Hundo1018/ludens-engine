"""The Frontier world (game/frontier.mojo), played by scripts: no window, no GPU.
Native only. `pixi run -e wasm test-game`.

Checks streaming (cells and bodies enter and leave the scene as the player moves, and a body comes back where it
was left), frustum culling (nothing visible is dropped, and something is), and determinism."""
