"""3-D vorticity confinement on `MacFluid3` (ROADMAP 17.60,
`physics.mac_fluid3` `set_confinement`). 16^3 periodic box, dx 1/16,
dt 1/60, nu 0, 120 steps (2 s).

Initial velocity: the 3-D Taylor-Green field with w = 0,
u = sin(2 pi x) cos(2 pi y) cos(2 pi z), v = -cos(2 pi x) sin(2 pi y) cos(2 pi z).
v depends on z, so the vorticity has all three components (the 2-D check of
`test_smoke` cannot exercise the z terms).

Predictions, written before the run:

  * eps 2 keeps more enstrophy than eps 0 after 2 s: ratio above 1.1. The
    2-D `test_smoke` measured 1.38 at eps 2 on a buoyant blob. That is a
    different flow, so it is a guide for the size, not the bound; the bound
    is 1.1.
  * The default (no `set_confinement` call) and `set_confinement(0)` give the
    same kinetic energy and enstrophy bit for bit: the guard skips the code.
  * eps < 0 raises.
  * With eps 2 the energy and enstrophy stay finite.

Measured (the one run that set the prediction above): enstrophy 3.95 at eps 0,
15.56 at eps 2, ratio 3.94; kinetic energy 0.0119 at eps 0, 0.0379 at eps 2,
ratio 3.2. All four checks pass.

The ratio is far above the 2-D figure (1.38), and the energy grows: confinement
is not energy-conserving, so it adds kinetic energy. One reason the 3-D number
is larger is the strength per cell: eps dx = 2 / 16 = 0.125 here, against
2 / 64 = 0.031 in `test_smoke`, four times stronger per cell. That is a
hypothesis about the size, not a measured split; `eps dx` was not varied.
Energy growth of 3.2x is recorded as a result of this setup, not as a check
of the method's accuracy.
