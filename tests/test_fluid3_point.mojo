"""Point drag in 3-D on `MacFluid3` (ROADMAP 17.61 in 3-D): the 3-D counterpart of
`test_fluid_flux` / `test_fluid_momentum`.

16^3 periodic box, dx 1/16, dt 1/120, nu 1e-3, 120 steps (1 s). A point starts at
the centre (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) moving +x at 1 m/s and is dragged toward the air
velocity with rate k (point-drag rule as in the 2-D test). Each step the impulse
it gives the air is applied with `add_impulse` (trilinear adjoint, per dx^3).
The air's total momentum should then change by exactly the total impulse.

Predictions, written before the run:

  * k = 5, flux path: relative residual below 1e-4 (the same argument as 2-D:
    flux form conserves the total, so the change equals the impulse up to f32
    accumulation).
  * k = 5, semi-Lagrangian path: relative residual above 0.10. The 2-D value at
    the same k was 2.27; that is recorded, not the bound.
  * The flux sub-step count is printed. dx^3 is 4x smaller than the 2-D dx^2 at
    n = 32, so the impulse per step is 4x larger, and the sub-step count may be
    heavy. If it is, the count is recorded; the test is not dropped for it.

Measured (one run): k 5 flux residual 2.3e-7, flux sub-steps 8398 over 120
steps (about 70 per step); semi-Lagrangian residual 1.69. Both predictions hold.
The semi-Lagrangian residual is smaller than the 2-D 2.27 at the same k. The
two setups differ in n, dx, and dimension, so no single cause is assigned; this
is one run, not a scaling law.
