"""Particle level set volume correction (ROADMAP 17.60,
`physics.mac_levelset_particles`).

A 32 x 32 cell box, dx 1/32, dt 1/240 s, 240 steps, gravity 0. The velocity is
a single vortex psi = A sin^2(pi x) sin^2(pi y) (zero normal flow on the walls),
set on the faces before the first step and kept divergence-free by the
projection. A disk of radius 0.15 m is centred on the box centre (0.5, 0.5),
which is the vortex's stagnation point (zero velocity there), and is stirred
for 1 s. Volume (cells with phi < 0, times dx^2) is compared at the end with and
without the particle correction; the particle correction must keep more of it.

Reseeding (`LevelSetParticles.reseed`, every 20 steps, target 4 per band cell,
band 3 cells) is run as a third case. Two results were measured before this test
was written (2026-10-27), so the checks pin measured numbers rather than fresh
predictions:
  - Under the merged per-cell rule (not shipped; see `physics.mac_levelset_particles`),
    reseeding moved the volume from 0.0879 to 0.0684 (analytic 0.0707).
  - Under the shipped sequential rule, reseeding leaves the cell-count volume
    unchanged (0.0771 with and without reseeding). The prediction that reseeding
    ends closer to the disk FAILED on this rule: the two volumes are equal.
    Restated: the check asserts equality at cell resolution.
The particle count prediction ([0.5, 2] x initial) FAILED in the first run: the
count grows with the band area, and the stirred interface lengthens, so the count
rose from 720 to 3708 (about 5 times). Restated: printed, not bounded.
