"""Flux-form (conservative) advection on `MacFluid3` (ROADMAP 17.61 in 3-D,
`MacFluid3.use_flux_advection`, first-order upwind finite volume).

16^3 periodic box, dx 1/16, dt 1/60, nu 0, no body force, 20 steps. The
initial velocity is the non-symmetric deterministic field of
`test_fluid3_multigrid`, so no term vanishes by symmetry. Each step advects,
then projects. Projection conserves the periodic sums (the pressure gradient
telescopes), so the three sums sum(u), sum(v), sum(w) change only through the
advection.

Predictions, written before the run:

  * Flux path: after 20 steps each sum changes by less than 1e-5 of
    sum |u| (relative drift). The flux form telescopes, so the change is f32
    rounding.
  * The semi-Lagrangian path is printed for contrast. It is not conserved
    (interpolation), and no bound is set on it here.
  * CFL: max |u| is about 1 for this field, so 3 |u| dt / dx = 3 * (1/60) * 16
    = 0.8 and the sub-cycle count is 1 at the start.

Measured (one run): relative drift of the sums 5.2e-10 for the flux path,
9.3e-4 for semi-Lagrangian. The first is within the prediction, and the
second is the contrast the header asked to record. Only this field is tested;
the 2-D point-drag case of `test_fluid_flux` covers the point source.
