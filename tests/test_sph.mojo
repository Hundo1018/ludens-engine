"""SPH physical gates, and the CFL limit that separates it from PBF.

The same containment / conservation / settling checks PBF gets, run on the same
particle state and grid so a difference in outcome is a difference in solver
rather than in setup.

The last check is the one that matters for choosing between them. SPH enforces
incompressibility by making the fluid STIFF, and a stiff explicit integrator is
CFL-limited: past some timestep it does not merely lose accuracy, it diverges.
PBF's projection has no such limit. Asserting that SPH is stable below a
timestep AND unstable above one pins the constraint as a measured property
instead of leaving it as received wisdom — and it is the reason the benchmark
sweeps dt rather than particle count.
