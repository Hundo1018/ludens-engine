# tier: integration
"""The adapter from `collision.contact_events.ContactEvent` (produced by a
REAL `physics.solver6.ContactScene6` stack -- ordinary rigid-body contact,
not a hand-built event list) onto `scheduler.events.Channel`, with a reader
that receives began/ended (roadmap 17.38's own wiring requirement).

LAYER NOTE (why the adapter lives here, not in `scheduler/events.mojo`):
`scheduler` and `collision` are BOTH layer 3 (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §1), so
`scheduler/events.mojo` cannot import `collision.contact_events` -- that
would be a same-layer edge, which the reach-through/cycle rules forbid.
`publish_contact_events` below is the "small adapter" the design note asks
for; its natural home is the future `gameplay` package (layer 5, ROADMAP
17.1+), which may import both `scheduler` and `collision`. Until `gameplay`
exists, this test IS the production-style caller architecture law v3
requires ("接上專案" -- reached by at least one real caller, not left as an
island the way `geometry/quickhull.mojo` was before `947a37f`)."""
