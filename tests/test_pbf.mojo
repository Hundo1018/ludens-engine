"""Position-Based Fluids: physical gates, not pictures.

A fluid solver is easy to make look plausible and hard to make correct, so the
checks here are the properties that fail loudly when the constraint projection
is wrong:

  containment  — no particle may leave the box, ever. A density solver that
                 overshoots pushes particles through walls, and this catches it
                 on every step rather than at the end.
  conservation — particle count and total mass are invariant by construction;
                 asserting them catches an indexing bug in the grid rebuild
                 that would silently drop particles from neighbour lists.
  compression  — a settled column must approach rest density. This is the
                 constraint actually doing its job, and it is checked as an
                 improvement over the unsolved state so the bar cannot be met
                 by a solver that does nothing.
  settling     — a dam break must lose kinetic energy and come to rest. A
                 solver with a sign error or a runaway lambda gains energy
                 instead, which no static check would catch.
