"""Contact events: began/stay/ended diff over two frames' contact sets
(audit cluster 2).

Pure set logic over `(a, b, feat)` keys -- no `Body6`, no `ColliderSet`, not
even collision geometry: whoever produced this step's contact set (brute
loop, any `BroadPhase` backend, a sensor overlap pass) hands over the keys
that touched, and this module says which of them are new, which persisted,
and which stopped. That is what lets sensors report overlap without ever
touching the impulse solver, and what will let 17.13 queries watch overlaps
without depending on physics at all.
