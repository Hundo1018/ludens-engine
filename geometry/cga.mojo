"""Conformal geometric algebra (CGA) geometry over Cl(4,1) — `CGA3`.

Promoted from `experiments/exp_cga_meet.mojo` after its meet decisions matched
euclidean geometry 4/4. Points lift onto the null cone
(`up(p) = p + ½|p|²n∞ + n₀`); spheres are grade-1 vectors
(`S = up(c) − ½r²n∞`), and incidence is algebra:

  up(a)·up(b) = −½|a−b|²          (distance is an inner product)
  P·S = 0 / >0 / <0               (on / inside / outside a sphere)
  (S₁∧S₂)² < 0                    (dual pencil: real intersection circle)

so a sphere-sphere test needs no case analysis — squared distance and overlap
both fall out of scalar products. `sphere_dist_sq` inverts
S₁·S₂ = ½(r₁² + r₂² − d²).
