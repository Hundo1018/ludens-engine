"""Gameplay event bus (ROADMAP 17.38): decoupled many-to-many delivery of
typed events (`OnPlayerDied`, contact began/ended, joint broke, ...) with a
DETERMINISTIC delivery order -- the property 17.39 (input replay) and 17.16
(rollback) both need: replaying the same sequence of `send()` calls must
reproduce bit-identical per-reader event streams.

`EventChannel` is the swap seam. `Channel[E]` is the production
implementation: a PULL model (readers keep a cursor and drain on their own
schedule, Bevy `EventReader` style) rather than a PUSH model that fans a copy
out to every subscriber at `send()` time. Pull is the Mojo-natural choice
here -- push delivery to a heterogeneous set of subscribers normally wants
boxed/type-erased callbacks, which this toolchain has no cheap way to do
(`ecs/reactive_backend.mojo`'s push observers get away with it because every
subscriber is filtered by the SAME `ObsEvent` shape; a gameplay event bus
carries arbitrary `E`, one `Channel[E]` per event type, so there is no shared
inbox type to erase into). `PushChannel[E]` is kept anyway, as the seam's
comparison partner (architecture law v2: every seam variant needs a parity
test AND a benchmark row) -- it mirrors `scheduler/message.mojo`'s mailbox
style (fan a copy out to every registered subscriber's own `List` at send
time) and is not meant to be the production choice.

DOUBLE BUFFER / RETENTION: an event sent during `update()`-period N is
visible through period N+1, then dropped -- "events live for two update()
calls" in the roadmap note. Concretely `Channel[E]` keeps `cur` (this
period's sends) and `prev` (last period's, about to age out), plus a global
monotonic `next_seq` used both as delivery order AND as each reader's cursor
position. This is what makes "a reader running before or after the writer in
a frame" (relative to when `update()` is called) still see every event
exactly once: whichever of `cur`/`prev` it lands in, a fresh reader's cursor
selects "everything at or after `cursor`", not a physical buffer index.

DETERMINISM: `next_seq` only ever increments by the order `send()` is
CALLED, single-threaded, with no other source of nondeterminism -- so two
runs that call `send()` in the same order produce identical sequence numbers
and therefore identical `read()` results for every reader (`test_events.mojo`
checks this directly by running the same send script twice).

CAPACITY / UNREAD DROPS (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §2, "capacity / budget
overflow" row): `Channel[E]` counts, in `dropped_unread`, every event that
ages out of `prev` while some reader's cursor was still behind it (the
"reader that never reads" extreme case) -- local field first, matching the
existing `LogRing`/`DrawQueue`/`TraceBuffer` convention of a self-contained
`dropped: Int` (see `diag/log.mojo`'s docstring for why: a container should
stay unit-testable without a live `Counters` bank in scope). `sync_counters`
then folds that local tally into a shared `diag.counters.Counters` bank
(`EVENT_DROPPED_UNREAD`) and resets it, so repeated calls don't double-count
-- the owning world/gameloop calls it once a frame, same as the general
"drop the thing that didn't fit, count it, never silently lose the count"
rule. `PushChannel[E]` has no such counter: nothing is ever dropped on that
side (an unread subscriber inbox just grows), which is exactly why pull is
the chosen production model -- documented, not silently absent.

Wiring the `collision.contact_events.ContactEvent` producer onto a channel
lives OUTSIDE this file: `collision` is layer 3, the same layer as
`scheduler` (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §1), so `scheduler/events.mojo` cannot
import it without a same-layer edge, which the reach-through/cycle rules
forbid. The small adapter that calls `ch.send(...)` for each
`ContactScene6.events` entry lives in
`tests/test_events_contacts.mojo` instead -- a test may import any layer.
The natural home is the future `gameplay` package (layer 5, ROADMAP 17.1
onward), which can import both `scheduler` and `collision`; until it exists,
the test IS the production-style caller architecture law v3 requires ("接上
專案" -- reached by at least one production-style caller, not left as an
island).
